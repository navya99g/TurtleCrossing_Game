# Turtle Crossing Game 🐢🚗

A simple Turtle Crossing game built with Python's `turtle` module. Guide the turtle across the road while avoiding moving cars. Each level gets harder as car speeds increase!

## How to Play
- Press **Up Arrow Key** to move the turtle forward.
- Avoid the cars—colliding ends the game.
- Reach the top to level up. Cars move faster with each level!
